# Geometry Jump 3D

This is a simple jump and run game implemented in OpenGL.

## Building

- `mkdir build`
- `cmake ..`
- `make all`

## Controls

- The player cube can be controlled with `W`, `A`, `S` and `D`.
- After every 20 jumps a savepoint is created, to which you can jump with `F`.
- With `Space` you can reset the player to the start.
- `E` triggers the random world generation.
- With `X` you can toggle the mouse capturing.
- `Q` toggles the flying mode, where `Space` is up and `LShift` is down.
